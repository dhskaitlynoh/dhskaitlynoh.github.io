<h1> my CCA</h1>
<title> This is my website </title>
<p>
My CCA is track and field and i have been in this CCA since Primary 4. I enjoy doing sprints, especially 100m. </p>
<p>
I like going for trainings as running helps me to relieve my stress, and I also enjoy the process of pushing myself physically during each session. </p>
<p>
Seeing myself improve during trainings or competitions is really rewarding, and even if i do not achieve my goal, it just pushes me to work harder. </p>
